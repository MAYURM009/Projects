aims to forecast consumer purchasing decisions based on their attributes and behavior. It involves collecting data on demographics, browsing habits, and past purchases, then preprocessing and selecting key features. A decision tree classifier is used to model the relationship between these features and purchase likelihood, creating a tree-like structure of decision rules. The model is trained and evaluated for accuracy, precision, and recall. Insights from the decision rules help businesses understand purchase drivers and refine marketing strategies. The final model is deployed for real-time predictions, aiding in targeted campaigns and inventory management.
