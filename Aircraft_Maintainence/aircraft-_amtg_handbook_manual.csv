"Preface"

"The Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook–General (FAA-H-8083-30B) was developed as one of a series of three"
"handbooks for persons preparing for mechanic certification with airframe or powerplant ratings, or both. It is intended that"
"this handbook will provide basic information on principles, fundamentals, and technical procedures in the subject matter"
"areas common to both the airframe and powerplant ratings. Emphasis in this volume is on theory and methods of application."
""
"The handbook is designed to aid students enrolled in a formal course of instruction preparing for FAA certification as a"
"maintenance technician as well as for current technicians who wish to improve their knowledge. This volume contains"
"information on mathematics, aircraft drawings, weight and balance, aircraft materials, processes and tools, physics, electricity,"
"inspection, ground operations, and FAA regulations governing the certification and work of maintenance technicians. New to"
"this volume is a section addressing how successful aviation maintenance technicians incorporate knowledge and awareness"
"of ethics, professionalism and human factors in the field."
""
"Because there are so many different types of airframes and powerplants in use today, it is reasonable to expect that differences"
"exist in the components and systems of each. To avoid undue repetition, the practice of using representative systems and"
"units is implemented throughout the handbook. Subject matter treatment is from a generalized point of view, and should be"
"supplemented by reference to manufacturers’ manuals or other publications if more detail is desired. This handbook is not"
"intended to replace, substitute for, or supersede official regulations or the manufacturers’ instructions."
""
"The companion handbooks to Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook–General (FAA-H-8083-30B) are the Aviation"
"Maintenance Technician Handbook–Airframe (FAA-H-8083-31 (as amended)), and the Aviation Maintenance Technician"
"Handbook–Powerplant (FAA-H-8083-32 (as amended))."
""
"This handbook is available for download, in pdf format, from www.faa.gov. Please visit this website for the latest version"
"of all FAA handbooks."

"Introduction"
""
""
""
""
"E"
"This Special Airworthiness Information Bulletin is to alert owners, operators, and maintenance"
"technicians of an airworthiness concern with aluminum seat belt mounting brackets affecting all"
""
""
""
""
"L"
"Cessna Models 120 and 140 airplanes. Textron Aviation has issued Service Bulletin SEB-25-03,"
"dated February 17, 2015, to address this concern."
""
""
""
""
"P"
"At this time, the airworthiness concern is not an unsafe condition that would warrant airworthiness"
"directive (AD) action under Title 14 of the Code of Federal Regulations (14 CFR) part 39."
""

""
""
"M"
"Background"
""
""
""
""
"A"
"On July 5, 2014, an accident occurred in Parma, New York where the pilot seat belt mounting"
""
""
""
""
"S"
"bracket, part number (p/n) 0425132, failed after the airplane overturned following departure from the"
"runway. Although cause of the failed bracket has not been determined and the investigation is"
"ongoing, it was noted that the original Cessna seat belt installation had been replaced with a four-"
"point Aero Fabricators harness per Supplemental Type Certificate (STC) SA1429GL in 2003. The"
"failed bracket was made of aluminum. However, Cessna now only provides steel brackets as a"
"replacement part for the aluminum brackets."
""
"Recommendations"
""
"The FAA recommends that owners, operators, and maintenance personnel of the affected airplanes"
"replace aluminum brackets with steel brackets following Cessna Service Bulletin SEB-25-03 dated"
"February 17, 2015. To make the determination as to whether the bracket is made of aluminum or"
"steel, a magnet may be used or look for evidence of iron oxide (rust)."
